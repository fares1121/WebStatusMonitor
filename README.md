# WebStatusMonitor:

# Description:
This project develops a web status monitor (a simplified version of uptimerobot.com). It contains an implementation of an HTTP client socket to interact with the web 
server without using any existing HTTP client library and encryption/decryption to requests/responses using the Python ssl library.
# Execution
The web monitor should start by typing:
python monitor.py urls-file
where urls-file is the name of the file containing URLs that will be monitored
